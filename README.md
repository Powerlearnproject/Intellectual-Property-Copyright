# 🧾 Intellectual Property & Copyright - Debt Risk & Recovery Platform

An AI-powered debt recovery and IP tracking platform designed to improve repayment communication and protect creative intellectual property. Developed for the CODEHER Hackathon 2025.

## 🛑 Problem: Communication for Effective Debt Recovery

In the world of debt recovery, **communication is everything** — yet current methods fall short based on client type and situation:

- ✉️ **Emails** (preferred for corporates) are formal and easy to track but lack urgency and are often ignored.
- 📞 **Phone calls** feel more urgent and personal but are avoided if suspected to be from collectors.
- 🚪 **Physical visits** drive commitment but are costly, time-consuming, and impractical for remote clients.

Additionally, IP misuse is hard to detect, and risk assessments are managed using outdated tools like Excel, which lack scalability, automation, and transparency.

## ✅ Solution

We’re developing a **smart risk and recovery platform** that replaces Excel with a **centralized, predictive, and integrated system**.

### Key Features:
- 🔄 **Automated multichannel communication** (Email, WhatsApp, Phone calls)
- 🧠 **Behavioral scoring and early warning system** for high-risk debtors
- 📊 **Visual repayment dashboards** and client engagement tracking
- 📜 **Smart IP rights monitoring** and contract usage enforcement

This platform is tailored to serve accelerators, creative funds (like HEVA), and individual creatives who need to track repayments and safeguard their IP.
